## Who am I?

I am a technology enthusiast. I also happen to work in the industry, somewhat. I enjoy music, amateur coding, data analysis and gaming.

So, yes - I am a "gamer" - but I wish to add the quotes, since in recent years I have enjoyed the adventure of getting the technology to work and seeing the FPS counter go up, more than I enjoy the games themselves!

I work as a Data Engineer in the healthcare industry.

Yes! That does mean I have access to patient data! I am part of a team which is responsible for storing and sharing the sensitive datasets between large organisations around research and development, decision making, and more.

Technologies I work with include:

- T-SQL
- Python
- Azure
- Kubernetes
- Docker
(I am not an expert in any of these, but am competent enough to keep us out of trouble and keep the bits flowing)

## Why this blog?

As a hobbyist and enthusiast, I have collected a number of machines that serve various purposes in my home network. I have always (until now at least) used Windows OS, and it gets the job done. I am increasingly ambivalent towards Microsoft around how they "dumb-down" their software (or at least that is my perception of it) and increasingly wish I knew more about other OS technology. I even seriously thought about designing my own! (Don't worry, the next "Temple OS" is _not_ on the horizon, not from me anyway.)

Therefore, I have dabbled in Linux in recent times. To start, I used one of my over-powered machines as a NAS and had loads of space for some VMs, so I started building Ubuntu Servers and using them for various internal services to see what I could do. I then added some of my new-found skills to create my own router (using ipfire). I even managed to build my own LAMP stack machine and bring into production my very own secure website! - please note, this is _not_ a challenge, I know very well there will be attack vectors exposed, so please don't take this as an invitation to try and find it and bring it down. That said, I'm still proud I managed to avoid some of the obvious pitfalls though.

## My equipment

So, here is a somewhat shortened list of what I have accumulated and have to use at my disposal:

### One UNRAID server:

- Ryzen 9 3950x
- 128GB RAM
- An array of old HDDs thrown together just to make use of these, amounting to ~4.5TB of cold storage
- A single 2TB nvme SSD for the vdisks and write-cache
- A spare (read: not redundant, just attached) 3TB HDD - I have no idea what I should do with this as it's too large to add to my array as either the storage or parity since the other HDDs are all much smaller, but I have used it for old SQL database files and stuff

### Two gaming PCs:

First, this is my older machine, exists simply because it's worth more to me as a spare than split up and sold as parts:

- Ryzen 5 3600
- 16GB RAM
- 1x 500GB boot and 1x 1TB mass storage nvme SSDs
- GTX 970

Second, this is one I took great pride in building and is my main machine:

- Ryzen 7 5800x3D
- 16GB RAM
- 1x 500GB boot and 1x 1TB mass storage nvme SSDs
- RTX 2080 Super

### One gaming laptop:

Picked this Asus TUF laptop up for cheap as B-Grade (major scratches, but all cosmetic and works amazingly well):

- Intel 11600
- 16GB RAM
- 1x 500GB boot and 1x 1TB mass storage nvme SSDs
- RTX 3060

### One oldish Surface 4 tablet

It's an old surface. I can't bring myself to replace it yet, but I'm likely ot go for a cheap iPad when I do.

### Printer

A single MFD: Lexmark CX310DN

### Network

My router is another PC that is just spare parts that I can't bring myself to part with:

- Ryzen 3 4100
- 8GB RAM
- 500GB SATA SSD
(I have already ordered a small replacement PC to become my permanent router solution)

I have some devices and a single switch with 2.5gb NICs, but mostly 1gb switches and devices. I have attempted to wire my entire house so that only my phone/surface/laptop uses wireless LAN, and it's an old 802.11ac router in bridge mode to serve as my only WAP.

### Other stuff

As would be expected of someone of my age, I have some retro and retro-simulating devices:

- A "The C64" (full-size)
- A Spectrum Next 
- An Amiga One x5000
- A Nintendo Wii
- A Playstation 3 (slim)
- A Raspberry Pi (Was a retro gaming device, now just sits there waiting for a project!)
