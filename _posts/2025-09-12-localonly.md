# Forcing windows to allow a local only account during first setup

I've not been as active on this blog as I intended, and my life has been taking an unexpected path. But I'm back to work on Arch Linux, but also wanted to ensure I had at least one Windows machine, just in case. Of course, although I have used windows for decades at this point, and have not had any personal objections to having a Microsoft account, I do find myself wanting to drop its use by default and jsut have a vanilla install. So, I find myself trying to search for that 'secret' code to avoid the account sign-in part of the setup. I remember seeing videos on YouTube about it, but couldn't find it anywhere. So, I've saved it as a gist. It's simple reeally:

1. Press `Shift` + `F10`

2. Type `start ms-cxh:localonly` and press enter
