## My Adventures in Arch Linux

So, what do you do when you are excited by the recent improvements in the Linux-gaming scene, and don't want to miss out? Considering you want to ditch Microsoft Windows anyway...

Well, time to seriously investigate the feasibility of daily driving a Linux distribution.

_Which one?_

That's a question I struggle with. For what it's worth, as a non-enterprise Microsoft user, you either choose Home or Professional, 10 or 11. But Linux...

...and then, does it even _have_ to be Linux? Why not a unix like Solaris, or one of the BSD OS flavours?

*sigh*

So, I needed a steer. Since my motivation was partly a gaming one (e.g. Valve's success with the Steam Deck OS) I thought I'd start there!

### Steam _Deck_ OS ... er ... 3.0?
(source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_Deck)

Turns out that the official OS for the Steam Deck is not _yet_ available as a stand-alone distribution! Now, since the Steam Machines of 2015, Valve has had a vested interest in having a "SteamOS" and so that _is_ available to us, The Great Unwashed.<sup>TM</sup>

But, these are not the same, as described in the wikipedia entry for the Steam Deck, these are based on two entirely different base distributions.

So what's the difference?

This is where I learn something new! I stumbled upon this tidbit of information when watching a YouTube VOD by [Typecraft](https://www.youtube.com/@typecraft_dev):

- Some distributions of Linux receive rolling updates, and
- some distributions of Linux are locked into "versions"

Ah! So when I install Ubuntu, I can choose a specific version, and there is no expectation that it will quietly and surreptitiously upgrade itself to a new version! That _might_ be important if you need to know from one day to the next over an extended period of time that the OS and software combination you rely on isn't going to suddenly develop a breaking change!

(I'm just imagining a world where a Windows version could suddenly just fundamentally change behavious between updates, glad that _never_ happens ;-) /s)

But if I am a casual, enthusiastic or hobbyist user, maybe there is some merit to trying the rolling-updating distribution...?

### But, do I _really_ want to use Arch, (BTW)?

Ok now I need to state something about myself as a person that (I'm very happy to admit) makes me stand out as "alternative" to my peers. I do not automatically accept what a "community" (for some definition of the work "community") has decided for me before I have judged for myself.

I hope that doesn't mark me as "special", but I do hope it gives me the advantage of not automatically accepting the perceived "norm" that "Arch has a steep learning curve, beginners must try something else."

But also, I've dabbled in Linux for a while now, and am just not excited by Ubuntu. Now I do not mean to pick on Ubuntu - it's done nothing wrong to me, I am _very_ happy with how it has performed for me when I needed it to, but it "just works!"

The issue with that, I'm afraid, is that I am merely replacing one boring desktop environment for another. Windows UI or Gnome UI? Does it matter?

Not really, not in my opinion. I can get stuff done Gnome (or KDE I'm sure) and it very inoffensive. But I _want_ a challenge! Am I brave enough? Will this all end in tears?

### Conclusion

Spoiler: I'm writing this very blog entry from a brand-new Arch installation! Next time, I'll break down how I got here.
